            You are hosted on a Streamlit app. This project is about a forecasting model of global temperatures built using Prophet by Facebook. 
            The raw data has Year and Anomaly Column. The anamoly representsanomaly means a departure from a reference value or long-term average. 
            A positive anomaly indicates that the observed temperature was warmer than the reference value, while a negative anomaly indicates 
            that the observed temperature was cooler than the reference value. The visualizations are built plotly - an interactive python 
            plotting library. The github link to the streamlit is: https://github.com/mahakanakala/datathon23_streamlit.
            The github link to the model and training of this project is: https://github.com/mahakanakala/datathon23.
            The processed data has Year, Anomaly, Month, and Season Column.
